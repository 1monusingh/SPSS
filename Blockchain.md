- The blockchain is an emerging technology that allows multiple parties to agree on a common state without the need for trusted intermediaries. Moreover, business process technology streamlines the automation of inter- and intra-organizational processes while cutting-down on costs.The reputation system has been designed as an effective mechanism to reduce risks associated with online shoppings
for customers. However it is vulnerable to rating fraud. Some ratings may inject unfairly high or low ratings to the system so as to promote their own products or demote their competitors.
- This study explores the rating fraud by differentiating the subjective fraud from objective fraud. Then it discusses the effectiveness of blockchain technology in objective fraud and its limitation in subjective fraud,especially the rating fraud. Lastly, it systematically 
analyzes the robustness of blockchain-based reputation systems in each type of rating fraud.
